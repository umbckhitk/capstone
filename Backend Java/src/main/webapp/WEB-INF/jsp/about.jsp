<p class="bg-light " >Interview scheduling software, also known as candidate interview scheduling software, automates the candidate interview scheduling process. It helps HR personnel and recruiters streamline the job interview process and provides an improved candidate experience. These automation tools eliminate back-and-forth emails and time-intensive phone calls, allowing HR personnel, hiring managers, and recruiters to view upcoming interview schedules in real time. Interview scheduling solutions access hiring managers' and interviewersâ€™ calendars for insight into when to schedule phone screens, onsite panel interviews, and video interviews. Features often include email and calendar integration, autofill email templates, and rescheduling options, as well as interviewer and candidate interview reminders sent via email or text. Interview scheduling software often integrates with applicant tracking systems (ATS) and is most commonly used in tandem with video interviewing software.

To qualify for inclusion in the Interview Scheduling category, a product must:

Streamline and simplify the interview scheduling process
Provide communication between HR personnel or recruiter and candidate during the interview scheduling process
Offer web-accessible calendars for candidates to book interviews, customizable or templated interview invitation emails, or both
Track candidate interviewing progress and/or provide integrations to ATS</p>
